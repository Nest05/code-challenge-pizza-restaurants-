# code-challenge-pizza-restaurants-
A challenge to build out the Flask API to add the functionality described in the deliverables below

## Deliverables
*Models*

You need to create the following relationships:

A Restaurant has many Pizzas through RestaurantPizza
A Pizza has many Restaurants through RestaurantPizza
A RestaurantPizza belongs to a Restaurant and belongs to a Pizza

*Validations*

Add validations to the RestaurantPizza model:

- must have a price between 1 and 30

Add validations to Restaurant Model:

- must have a name less than 50 words in length
- must have a unique name

*Routes*

Set up the following routes. Make sure to return JSON data in the format specified along with the appropriate HTTP verb.

- GET /restaurants

Return JSON data in the format below:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Dominion Pizza",
    "address": "Good Italian, Ngong Road, 5th Avenue"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Pizza Hut",
    "address": "Westgate Mall, Mwanzi Road, Nrb 100"
  }
]
```
- GET /restaurants/:id

If the Restaurant exists, return JSON data in the format below:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Dominion Pizza",
  "address": "Good Italian, Ngong Road, 5th Avenue",
  "pizzas": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Cheese",
      "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Pepperoni",
      "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese, Pepperoni"
    }
  ]
}
```
If the Restaurant does not exist, return the following JSON data, along with the appropriate HTTP status code:
```json
{
  "error": "Restaurant not found"
}
```
- DELETE /restaurants/:id

If the Restaurant exists, it should be removed from the database, along with any RestaurantPizzas that are associated with it (a RestaurantPizza belongs to a Restaurant, so you need to delete the RestaurantPizzas before the Restaurant can be deleted).

After deleting the Restaurant, return an empty response body, along with the appropriate HTTP status code.

If the Restaurant does not exist, return the following JSON data, along with the appropriate HTTP status code:
```json
{
  "error": "Restaurant not found"
}
```
- GET /pizzas

Return JSON data in the format below:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Cheese",
    "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Pepperoni",
    "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese, Pepperoni"
  }
]
```
- POST /restaurant_pizzas

This route should create a new RestaurantPizza that is associated with an existing Pizza and Restaurant. It should accept an object with the following properties in the body of the request:
```json
{
  "price": 5,
  "pizza_id": 1,
  "restaurant_id": 3
}
```
If the RestaurantPizza is created successfully, send back a response with the data related to the Pizza:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Cheese",
  "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese"
}
```
If the RestaurantPizza is not created successfully, return the following JSON data, along with the appropriate HTTP status code:
```json
{
  "errors": ["validation errors"]
}
```
